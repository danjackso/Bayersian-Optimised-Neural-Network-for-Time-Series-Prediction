# Bayersian-Optimised-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction

Neural network hyperparameter and architecture optimisation using keras tuners for time series prediction.

The deep neural network consists of many layers including, Dense, LSTM, convolutional and max pooling. The bayesian optimiser finds the optimal number of each of these layers plus the optimal number of units in each layer. Albeit a slow process, the optimiser produces much better results than conventionally fitting a neural network.
